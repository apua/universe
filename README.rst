Universe
========

The original purpose of this project is to build a home page where I can put my staffs.

But I like the color settings which is used for test,
and I have another design of my home page,
so it became a seperated project.

Now I locate this project as an art piece, these stars are beautiful.


Users can use the following keys to interact with the stars:

Number - Choose shape
Home - Slowly add to 600 stars (Press Esc to stop)
End  - Slowly reduce to 3 stars (Press Esc to stop)
PgUp - Add one star
PgDn - Reduce one star
Enter - Change the shape of stars in the sky
Space - Toggle rotating
d - Clean stars
c - Change color

Mouse whell - Change the diameter of the star cloud

(Based on Keymanager as usual.)

I Hope you'll like it :)
